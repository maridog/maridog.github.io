# Marie-Dominique Garnier

Professor of English Literature and Gender Studies at the University of Paris 8 at St-Denis (formerly Vincennes University), I have taught there since 1996 and have been attached to the Department of Womenâ€™s and Gender Studies since 2007. I divide my teaching between literature, translation studies and gender studies, with particular insistence on the articulation of French philosophy (Deleuze, Derrida, Lyotard, Foucault), queer writing/queer photography. I am a member of
"LEGS"-- our CNRS/Paris8/Paris10 research laboratory.
Some of my recent publications include two co-edited volumes,
*Cixous sous X* (2010) and *Cixous Party/Partie de Cixous* (2014), and several essays on Cixous. I have published a volume on language and gender, *Alphagenre: graphique et politique* (2016), and translated an experimental volume of poetry and architecture by Madeline Gins (*Helen Keller or Arakawa*, 2017).
