# Research

My current research projects include a re-reading of contemporary essays by “male” philosophers (Jean-François Lyotard, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault) through gender-based concepts, involving a critique of blind spots in their writing as well as possible paths for the queering/unmounting of their received theoretical voices. In one project the concept of “becoming” imported from the Deleuze and Guattari corpus is revised as a “turning”, a re/volving or re/volting --  involving a book-length study of their key-concept, following up on my earlier “V for Deleuze” essay.
